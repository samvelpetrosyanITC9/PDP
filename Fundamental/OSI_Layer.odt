1. Physical Layer
Function: Defines the physical aspects of network communication such as cables, radio frequencies, or other physical means.
Data Type: Bits (0s and 1s).
Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, wireless radio frequencies, hubs.

2. Data Link Layer
Function: Responsible for node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and correction over the physical link.
Data Type: Frames.
Sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addresses, switches.

3. Network Layer
Function: Handles logical addressing and routing of data between different networks.
Data Type: Packets.
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers, IPv4/IPv6, ICMP.

4. Transport Layer
Function: Ensures reliable transmission of data, error recovery, flow control, and segmentation.
Data Type: Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP).
Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. Session Layer
Function: Manages sessions or connections between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
Data Type: Data streams.
Examples: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

6. Presentation Layer
Function: Ensures that data is in a usable format and is presented properly. It handles data encryption, compression, and translation.
Data Type: Formatted data.
Examples: JPEG, ASCII, SSL/TLS.

7. Application Layer
Function: Closest to the end-user, this layer provides network services directly to applications.
Data Type: User data.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
